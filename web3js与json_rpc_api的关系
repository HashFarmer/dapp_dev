Before web3.js came along, the only way we could interact with smart contracts was through the json-rpc API provided by the Ethereum node that acted as a json-rpc server.

That was not an easy task.

But thanks to web3.js, you don’t have to worry about the low-level details of JSON-RPC calls anymore since it provides an abstraction of the Ethereum json-rpc interface.

As such, you can start interacting with an Ethereum node using plain JavaScript. Simply put, web3.js exposes JSON-RPC APIs as JavaScript APIs.
